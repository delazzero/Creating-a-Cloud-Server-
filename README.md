Creating a Cloud Server through Amazon Web Services Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) 

Amazon Web Services Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is “a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud.” It is a small cloud server that can expand as traffic increases. 

This tutorial provides instructions for initial set up of the cloud server. 

Steps:
1.	Go to Amazon Web Services;
2.	Sign up; and 
3.	See list of web services; choose “EC2 Dashboard.” Important elements of dashboard:

a. In the upper right corner of screen, see provision services by regions (e.g., U.S. Northeast). This is important because it indicates the location of your information packet, which has to physically travel. Choose local because when services are close, this improves performance and reduces unnecessary labor.
b.	Limits are important (pricing, bandwidth)
c.	AWS offers different types of instances.

To launch an instance: 

Key Steps 
Leave automatic setup, except for following:

1.	Chose general purpose/free tier instance type
2.	Chose number of instances (e.g., 1)
3.	Enable protect
4.	Stage instance: whatever tag you want
5.	Configure security group
6.	Create new security group
7.	Launch
8.	Create a new key pair
9.	Save file on drive
10.	Note that the key should look like unintelligible code

Congrats! Now you have your first cloud server!
